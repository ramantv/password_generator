# Password Generator

This project implements a password generator based on user selected criteria.
- The user is prompted for:
    - The length of the desired random password.
    - The types of characters that s/he wants to include in the password. (lower case alphabet, upper case alphabet, numbers, special characters)
- The user input is validated to ensure that:
    - The desired length is between 8 and 128 and 
    - At least one type of character is desired.
- After the user answers all prompts a random password is generated based on the selected criteria and displayed on the page.
